Openstack API python-lets examples
===================================

Some simple examples of openstack API usage from python which
mimic their command line equivalents.

Hopefully to help as prototype for more interesting OS applications :)

All these assume you've already loaded your openstack credentials
from your ``openrc.sh`` file, namely ``OS_USERNAME``,
``OS_TENANT_NAME``, ``OS_PASSWORD``, ``OS_AUTH_URL``,
``OS_REGION_NAME``.
